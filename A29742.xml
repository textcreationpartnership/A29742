            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHen firſt I applied my Mind to publiſh ſomewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my <hi>Rotula Arithmetica;</hi> I deſigned only (without Preface or Apology) to ſet down, in the plaineſt and moſt homely Dreſs, ſuch Rules as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe, who ſhould happen to have both a Book and a <hi>Rotula,</hi> capable by the Help of the one, to make Uſe of the other; not doubting, but that ſuch an uſefull, <hi>Machine</hi> as it is, would be very acceptable to all ſorts of perſons; men that want Arthemetick being by this means, in the ſpace of four Hours
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49262:3"/>made capable to Add, Subſtract, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and Divide without any other previous Knowledge, than that of Reading Figures, tho' otherwiſe ſuch Perſons were not able readily to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend whether 7 and 4 were 11 or 12: and the ableſt Maſters, being by the help of this <hi>Machine</hi> rendered more able to performe the moſt tedious, and moſt numerous Operations of Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Multiplication and Diviſion, with the greateſt Certainty, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all that Rack of Intention, to which they are, by all the other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods hitherto known, obliged. But before I was readie to appear in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, I underſtood by ſeverall Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it is as unfit for new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, to go abroad, without the Helmet or cover of a preface, as it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe for a <hi>Highland-man,</hi> to travel amongſt thoſe Nighbours, with whom he is at Variance, without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his Broad <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Target.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed ſome Perſons have been ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49262:3"/>unjuſt as to ſpread a report that the <hi>Rotula</hi> is no new thing, but an old Invention of one <hi>Delamain,</hi> an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> man, who obtained from King <hi>Charles</hi> I. a Priviledge for his Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Ring <hi>Anno</hi> 1630. Now this Report, as falſe as it is, was at firſt no ſmall prejudice againſt the <hi>Rotula,</hi> in the Opinion of thoſe, who knew no better, and who had a great defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the ſentiments of thoſe, who were the Raiſers and Spreaders of this report: and all I my ſelf could ſay at firſt, (having never ſeen <hi>Delamain</hi>'s Book nor Inſtrument) was, that if the <hi>Rotula</hi> had ever been known in the World before, it had never been out of faſhion, but had very ſoon after publication become very near as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Balance or an elln-wand, every one, who hath any thing conſiderable to meaſure or weigh, having likewiſe ſome Accompt to caſt.</p>
                  <p>But tho' this ſeemed to me a ſufficient Demonſtration concerning the Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     </gap> with in this affair, upon the Score of malice; that baſe Vice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as far below men of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Liberal Education, as it lyes out of the Road of my Actions to give them any other Provocation, than that of being an Inventor: Nor can it be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Ignorance; for they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably men of Profound Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Knowledge; It muſt then be chargeable meerly upon the Score of Raſhneſs, for had they but been at the Pains to Compare both Inſtruments together, they might have eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Difference to be as great as that betwixt a Line of <hi>Logarithme</hi> Numbers, and a Scale of equal parts:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49262:5"/>and for this cauſe I think I may Juſtly Charge them with Injuſtice, according to that known Maxime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qui ſtatuerit aliquid, parte inaudita altera, licet aequum statuerit, haud tamen aequus fuit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How reaſonably then may the man be charged with Injuſtice, who paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only a harſh, but an unjuſt Verdict and Cenſure on a thing he hath not been at the pains duely to examin and conſider.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed; Our worthy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man the Lord <hi>Naper</hi> Baron of <hi>Merchiſtoun,</hi> Invented the <hi>Logarithm</hi>-Tables; and Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, Converted theſe Tables into a ſtraight Lined Scale; after him Mr. <hi>Delamain,</hi> who was <hi>Gunter</hi>'s Scholar converted <hi>Gunter's</hi> Scale into a double Circle, merely to eaſe men of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes: But then his Ring like <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> Scale, at that time, did only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of one Line of Numbers, <hi>Sines</hi> and <hi>Tangents:</hi> and as he never dreamed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49262:6"/>of performing Addition, or Subſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by the help of his <hi>Machine,</hi> ſo he Ingenouſly acknowledges that it was not capable to performe even Diviſion and Multiplication to an Arithmeticall exactneſs; But many times a man might come ſhort of very near an Unite; Nay He might have added that in Numbers of many Places a man may be ſome times to ſeek for Units, and Tens, if not for Hundreds. Nay to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more certain the author requires That, which he propoſes as a portable Inſtrument, to be made of ſeverall Foots or Ellns Diameter, which would render it unweeldy, and conſequently leſs uſefull, either by Sea or Land: and it is not Improbable, that for theſe defects, that Inſtrument hath been antiquated, and hath given place to the Double Scale of Proportion, now ſo much in uſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Rotula</hi> performes all the four Arithmeticall Operations Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically, and to an Arithmeticall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49262:6"/>Exactneſs, not only of the Integers, but even of the Decimalls, whither <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>Infinite.</hi> So that a man, who can but work by the <hi>Rotula,</hi> may within a little Time and Practice, learn to work by the Pen; if he ſhould chance to want his <hi>Machine;</hi> Nay I believe, when the <hi>Rotula's</hi> are once become common, the mother may teach her Children at home, as much Arithemetick, as may ſerve them all their lives.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now cloſe this tedious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Preface, but that I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give ſome account of Mr. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and his Invention called his <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This Mr. <hi>Glover</hi> is a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe Elder Brother <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was this <hi>John's</hi> Maſter, was my Scholar about the Year 74. at which time he learned from me that Skill in Numbers and other things which he afterwards taught this Gentleman, and by which both of them have ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come famous abroad.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49262:7"/>
                  <p>Now tho' this Invention of <hi>John Glover's</hi> be Poſterior to my <hi>Rotula,</hi> as appears by the Date of his Privilege, Granted by his Majeſtie of <hi>France,</hi> which is of the 13. of <hi>March</hi> 1699. whereas my Privilege is granted in <hi>Scotland</hi> on the firſt of <hi>December</hi> 1698. Yet his comes ſo far ſhort of mine, that <hi>I</hi> Verily believe, had he ſeen or gotten a perfect Account of mine before he propoſed his own, he would have ſpared the pains of Publication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> muſt Confeſs that for any thing I yet know, his Tables or Circles for Multiplication and Diviſion (which indeed are very Ingenious, and haue coſt him much Thought) are his own; as alſo his Tables for the Reduction of Pence to ſhillings, &amp; ſhillings to Pounds. But in that Part which is common with his <hi>Roue</hi> and my <hi>Rotula,</hi> he ſeems to haue got ſome hint of mine; and this I am the more apt to belive becauſe about the time that <hi>I</hi> was buſſie in contriving the <hi>Rotula,</hi> there was a very ſmart Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49262:7"/>a near friend of his, Scholar with me at <hi>Stirline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which gives me greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this particular, is ſome expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his own Book which makes me fancy that he hath, at leaſt, got ſome imperfect Deſcription of mine, before he contrived that part of his which ſerves for Addition and Subſtraction.</p>
                  <p>For, whereas there is on my fixt Plate 3. Circles, he ſpeaks of three, and yet Immediatly he takes away two of his, &amp; turns them into Tables for Reduceing of Pence into ſhillings, and ſhillings into pounds, &amp; theſe not exceeding the limits of 120. and inſtead of the third on the <hi>fixt</hi> he gives us nothing but a little ſeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about a fifth part divided into parts begining at 0. and ending at 24. which he calls his fixt <hi>Index:</hi> as alſo whereas my Circle is divided into 100. parts; he Chuſes, (to make his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from mine) 120. as being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Product of 10. 12. and 20. Theſe Numbers (as he alleadges in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49262:8"/>of his <hi>1ſt.</hi> Chapter) being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to all other Numbers whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and yet near the cloſe of the ſame Chapter he acknowledges that it would be better to divide the Circle for Addition and Subſtraction into 100 parts or ſome Power of 10. and ſo the Inſtrument would become uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall: All which give me ſuſpicion that in this part, he hath goten, at leaſt ſome lame account of mine.</p>
                  <p>Moreover his Inſtrument is Defective and comes far ſhort of mine, even in Addition; For in his, the Practitioner is obliged to mind or mark down how many Revolutions his moveable Plate makes, and every one being 120, he hath 120 to Multiply by the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Revolutions, which is not only troubleſom, but likeways dangerous eſpecially in reall Buſſineſs, where a man whoſe mind is buſſied both about the figures of his Columne, and the points of his moveable plate, is obliged at the ſame time to mind the ſeverall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49262:8"/>Revolutions of his moveable Plate, of which for every one he forgets, or overlooks, he loſes 120 for his Pains; whereas in mine a man is not tied to any ſuch intention above once for 1000. (which is more than any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne does ordinarly contain) the moveable Plate, at every Revolution both marking and giving notice of the number of Revolutions.</p>
                  <p>But, beſides this, in my <hi>Rotula</hi> the ſame Circles that ſerve for Addition and Subſtraction ſerve likeways for Multiplication and Diviſion, but in his <hi>Roue</hi> he hath one for Addition and Subſtraction and ten or eleven for Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication and Diviſion and yet tho' the Circles were twice as large, and tho' they contained near twice as many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures as they do, they would be no more than what is neceſſary to do, what I am able to perform by mine.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly whereas his Tables are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined only to ſhillings and pence, and theſe of limited Number not exceeding,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49262:9"/>120. There are on the waſte, on the middle of my moveable Plate, Tables for the Reduction of ſhillings, Pence, Farthings, Weights and Meaſures, be the Numbers never ſo large; Beſides the Decimall Tables for Money, weights Meaſures and the moſt ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fractions: By the help of which ſix laſt ſort of Tables, the Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Diviſion of Complex Numbers does become juſt as eaſie as that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegers; without all that tediouſneſs which Mr <hi>Glover</hi> propoſes in his Book.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, what I have ſaid here is no more than was neceſſary for the Vindication of my own Invention, and to ſatisfie thoſe, who already are, or hereafter may be miſinformed either by the Story of <hi>Delamain,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>'s <hi>Roue Arithmetique,</hi> who for what is Peculliarly his, deſerves a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of commendation and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. <hi>I.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Rotula,</hi> and the Rectification thereof.</head>
                     <p>ALbeit in Books of this Nature, it be uſuall to prefix a Scheme of the Machine of which they treat; Yet I have thought fit in this, to omit that; becauſe ſuch as have a <hi>Rotula,</hi> need not a Scheme, and ſuch as want one, have no uſe for a Book; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as briefly as I can) deſcribe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,</hi> and then ſhew You how to uſe it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rotula</hi> Conſiſts of two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Parts, to wit, a <hi>Circular</hi> Plain moving upon a <hi>Center-pin,</hi> this we call the <hi>Moveable Plate;</hi> and a <hi>Ring,</hi> whoſe Circles are deſcribed from the ſame Center, this we call the <hi>Fixed Plate;</hi> Becauſe it is fixed to the Box, to ſecure it from moving about the Center, as the other does.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49262:10"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Fixed Plate</hi> is divided into three parts by two <hi>Circles;</hi> the Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of which is doubled, with a little Interſtice for <hi>Peg-Holes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Near the Circumference of the Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, there is another <hi>Double Circle,</hi> with a ſmall Interſtice alſo betwixt them, for <hi>Peg Holes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſpace without the double Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, on the <hi>Moveable,</hi> and within that on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> are both of them equally divided into 100. Parts: and both are Numbered, beginning at 0. 1. 2. 3. and ſo proceeding in a Naturall Order to 99. all the Diviſions being drawen ſtreight from the Center.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>Fixt</hi> many of theſe Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are protracted, ſome only to the middle part; and others run over both: for confining the ſeverall ſingle Coef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficents of the Reſpective Tabular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to which they are Prefixed, with this Caution when the Coefficients are the ſame, they are ſet down in the uttermoſt part; and when any Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49262:10"/>admits of two pair of <hi>Coefficients,</hi> the one Pair is ſet in the <hi>Midmoſt</hi> and the other in the <hi>Out-moſt</hi> Part. Thus againſt 18. on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> You will find in the <hi>midmoſt</hi> Part, 2 × 9 (that is two times Nine or Nine times two; This × croſs ſignifieing the word <hi>times</hi>) and 3 × 6 in the outmoſt. Alſo on the <hi>Moveable</hi> there is a Segment of a <hi>Circle,</hi> within the <hi>Peg-hole Circle,</hi> beginning at 9. of the Naturall Numbers and ending at 72. This Segment is likewiſe Divided by the ſame lines that Divide the outmoſt <hi>Circle</hi> of Naturall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into equall parts.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>Fixt Plate</hi> at the Diviſion betwixt 99 and 0 there is a little bit of Metal Screwed or Rivited, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likeways a lit le further than the <hi>Peg-hole Circle,</hi> on the <hi>Moveable,</hi> this piece of Metall we call the <hi>Stop:</hi> and muſt always be placed next Your left hand, with the Number 25, or 30. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your Breaſt. There is alſo on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> over againſt the Numbers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49262:11"/>89. or 90. a little <hi>Circle</hi> Divided into to equal Parts; with a little <hi>Palme,</hi> which ſhifts one part at every revolution of the <hi>Moveable;</hi> So that the figure, at which this <hi>Palme</hi> Points, Signifies the Number of Revolutions or Hundreds You have in your Accompt, or the Columne laſt added</p>
                     <p>When the Figures of the <hi>Moveable Plate</hi> move towards that ſide of the <hi>Stop,</hi> which is next the Cypher on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> we call the motion forward; but when they retire from it, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is backward.</p>
                     <p>In Rectification, be ſure not to touch the little <hi>Palme,</hi> till the Unites or Numbers beginning with a Cypher on the <hi>Moveable,</hi> be ſome of them againſt the Nynties on the <hi>Fixt;</hi> and then turne the little <hi>Palme</hi> to the Cypher of it's Proper <hi>Circle;</hi> after which turn back the <hi>Moveable,</hi> till it will Move no further, and ſo when the Cyphers of the <hi>Moveable</hi> are juſt at the <hi>Stop,</hi> as well as the <hi>Palme</hi> of the little <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49262:11"/>at it's Cypher; The <hi>Rotula</hi> is <hi>Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> and ready for Operation.</p>
                     <p>I have filled up the Vacant Space in the middle of the <hi>Moveable</hi> with <hi>Decimal Tables,</hi> and Tables <hi>of Common Diviſors,</hi> very uſefull for thoſe, that have much Buſſineſs, or are in haſt.</p>
                     <p>Onely obſerve carefuly that the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, on the right ſide of the <hi>Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> are <hi>Top-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>e turvie;</hi> So that You muſt alwayes take that which appears to be a <hi>9th.</hi> for a <hi>6th.</hi> and on the Contrary the <hi>6th.</hi> for a <hi>9th.</hi> and mind well, that the Unites are always next the Center, and the Tens next the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference: thus 61. will appear 19. and 91. will look like 16.</p>

                     <p>After the ſame manner, You may Add all other Species whatſoever; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding allways You Divide the leſſer Species by their proper Denominators, in Reduceing them to the next great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Species.</p>

                     <p>Thus, in Integers, 10 is allways the Denominator; Becauſe 10 in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Unites, makes but one in the Column of Tens; and 10 in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Tens, makes but one in the Column of Hundereds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, the Denominator of Tens is 100. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bſtraction</hi> finds the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two unequal Numbers.</p>
                     <p>The greater of theſe two Numbers is called the <hi>Charge;</hi> and the leſſer, the <hi>Diſcharge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Substraction,</hi> you muſt allways bring the ſeveral Figures of the <hi>Charge,</hi> one after another, together with the reſpective Figures of the <hi>Diſcharge;</hi> the one on the <hi>Moveable,</hi> and the other on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> directly againſt one another; and if the Figure of the <hi>Charge</hi> be equal to, or greater than the reſpective Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the <hi>Diſcharge,</hi> you have the Remainder at the <hi>Stop,</hi> on the <hi>Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Figure of the <hi>Diſcharge</hi> be greater than that of the <hi>Charge,</hi> then againſt the Denominator of the Species,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49262:15"/>on the <hi>Moveable,</hi> you have the Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mainder on the <hi>Fixt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, were I to take 8 from 8, or 7 from 7, having ſet the one againſt the other, you have 0 at the <hi>Stop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So likeways, if I were to take 5 from 8; having brought 8 on the <hi>Moveable,</hi> againſt 5 on the <hi>Fixt:</hi> I have at the <hi>Stop,</hi> on the <hi>Moveable,</hi> 3 for a Remainder. But, if I had been to take <hi>8lib.</hi> from <hi>5lib.</hi> the Remainder is on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> againſt 10 (the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator of Integers) on the <hi>Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> And <hi>8d.</hi> from 5 <hi>pennies,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> againſt 12 (the Denominator of Pennies) on the <hi>Moveable.</hi> And <hi>8ſh.</hi> from <hi>5ſh.</hi> the Remainder is ſtill on ehe <hi>Fixt,</hi> againſt 20 (the Denominator of ſhillings) on the <hi>Moveable.</hi> And 8 <hi>Ounces</hi> from 5 <hi>Ounces,</hi> the Remainder is on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> againſt 16 (the Denominator of Ounces) on the <hi>Moveable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Peaſon of all this is plain; becauſe the <hi>Diſcharge,</hi> in this caſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49262:16"/>be taken off the <hi>Charge,</hi> but off the <hi>Denominator,</hi> which is equivalent to a borrowed one of the next greater Species, and the Overplus, by the very Poſition of the Inſtrument, is added to the <hi>Charge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Only mind carefully, that as often as the Remainder is found on the <hi>Fixt,</hi> (which allways happens when any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the <hi>Diſcharge</hi> is greater than the reſpective Figure of the <hi>Charge</hi>) you muſt, in that caſe, eſteem the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Figure of the <hi>Diſcharge</hi> an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite more than really it is; Taking 1 for 0, and 2 for 1, and 3 for 2, and ſo of others.</p>

                        </p>

                     <head>CHAP. <hi>VII.</hi> Concerning the Rule of 3.</head>
                     <p>IN the Queſtions of this Rule, there are allways three Numbers, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly given or ſupoſed, to find a Fourth.</p>
                     <p>Of the given Numbers, there are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways two of the ſame ſort, Species or Notion, &amp; theſe we ſhall call <hi>Relative Numbers,</hi> &amp; the other or third Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which falls under a different Notion, we ſhall call the ſingular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and the fourth Number demanded (which is allways of the ſame Species, or Notion with the ſingular Number) we call the Anſwer; becauſe, when it is found, it Anſwers the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſave you the trouble of two Rules, one Direct, and another Reverſe: I ſhall lay down ſuch eaſie Directions, as may render a Man capable to Anſwer Queſtions of either, without any ſuch Diſtinction.</p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49262:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>In diſcerning the <hi>Diviſor,</hi> (which is all the difficulty, and which muſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be one or other of the Relative Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) you muſt carefully conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Anſwer ought to be greater, or leſſer than the ſingular Number For,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1ſt.</hi> When the Anſwer ought to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the ſingular Number, then the leaſt of the Relative Numbers muſt be the <hi>Diviſor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2ly.</hi> But if the Anſwer ought to be leſs than the ſingular Number, then the greateſt of the Relative Numbers muſt be the <hi>Diviſor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having diſcovered the <hi>Diviſor,</hi> ſet it down next your Left-Hand, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, (which we now call <hi>Coeffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi>) at a convenient Diſtance; the one, (it matters not which) before, the other after [∷] which we call the ſigne of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
                     <p>The Numbers thus dispoſed, Multiply the <hi>Coefficients</hi> and Divide the <hi>Product,</hi> by the <hi>Diviſor</hi> and the <hi>Quotient,</hi> yields you the Anſwer; Only obſerve, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49262:40"/>when the <hi>Diviſor</hi> is an Unite, there will be no uſe for <hi>Diviſion;</hi> and on the other hand, when one of the <hi>Coefficients</hi> is an Unite there, will be no <hi>Multiplication.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As alſo, if one of the <hi>Coefficients</hi> have an Infinite annexed to it, be ſure to make that the <hi>Multiplicand.</hi>

                     <p>The elements are found to be ſoure by ſenſe (which the Phyſicians doe ſollow): Firſt for that more ſimple bodies cannot be ſhewed: 2, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath alotted vnto them certaine places, to the end that other things might by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be bred, and nouriſhed: 3, nothing els can euidently be ſhewed, wherof other things may be made: 4, in liuing cretures there are certain parts, agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto the natures of the ſeuerall elements.</p>
                     <p>The Elementes are found to be foure, by two reaſons: the former whereof is drawen from the number of the foure prime quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the foure folde poſſible knitting together of them. For heate may be ioyned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with drineſſe, which two make fire, or els with moiſture, which two do make vp aer: and colde may be ioyned with moiſture, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe in the water: or with drineſſe, as in earth. The later reaſon is taken from the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er folde difference of the right motion: For the elements are directly moued, either vpwarde or downward.</p>
                     <p>Such things as moue vpward as light thinges do, are ſaid ſo to do, either ſimplie, as the fire, which is the lighteſt of the reſt: or reſpectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as the aer, which is lighter then the water, or the earth.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49262:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>Such things as moue downeward, as heanye things do, are ſaid ſo to do, either reſpectiuelie, as the water compared vnto the fire, and aer: or ſimplie as the earth, which is the heauieſt of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation and order of the Elementes, is found either by their motion, or els by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of their qualities.</p>
                     <p>And firſt by the motion: For inaſmuch as the fire and the aer do naturally moue vpward, the fier ſhall occupy the higheſt place: the aer, an vpper place: and for that the water and the earth do naturally moue downward, the water ſhall poſſeſſe a lower place, and the earth the loweſt.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the order of the Elements is found out by the communication of their qualities, for it were vnſit that ſuch things as are merely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but ſuch as in ſome ſorte can agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould be nigh one another. The fire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhalbe ioyned vnto the aer, by reaſon of the heate common vnto them both: the aer vnto the water, by reaſon of the common moiſture: and the earth vnto the water, by reaſon of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe common to them both.</p>

                     <p>THe whole frame of the world is caried round about, with 2. motions, each of them being, diſtinguiſhed from the other in name, and in reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The one of them is called the firſt and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
<pb facs="tcp:49262:60"/>motion: likewiſe the diurnall or worldlye motion, becauſe it bringeth the day vnto the world. For in this motion the ☉ and all the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies do euery day ariſe and ſet: they call it alſo the violent, and rapt motion, becauſe by the violent ſwiftnes thereof, it carrieth with it the reſt of the Spheres.</p>
                     <p>The other is called the ſecond and particular motion, altogether contrary vnto the former, as by which all the particular orbes do reſiſt the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall motion. They call it alſo <hi>Siniſter motus,</hi> the motion to the left hand, as the former is in like ſorte called <hi>dexter,</hi> that is, the motion to the right hand.</p>
                     <p>The 2. motions are alſo diſtinguiſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reaſon or the ſubſtance in the which they are inherent: For they differ the one from the other three waies.</p>
                     <p>The firſt difference is in reſpect either of the whole: For the diurnal motion is common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the celeſtiall bodies: or els of the partes, or ſtarres either fixed or wandring, which haue a motion peculiar and propre vnto themſelues.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond difference is either in regarde of the ſituation of the Axes, For the diurnall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made vpon the Axe and poles of the world, and therfore the Equator diuideth it in the middle: but the propre motion is made vpon the Axe and poles of the Zodiake, and therefore the Zodiake doth cut it in the middle: Or els it is in regarde of the poſition of the termes: inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the diurnall reuolution is made from the Eaſt vnto the weſt, or as <hi>Plinte</hi> termeth it,
<pb facs="tcp:49262:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>from the right towarde the lefte hand: but the propre reuolution is from the Weſt vnto the Eaſt, or from the left toward the right hand.</p>
                     <p>The third difference is in conſideration of the ſwiftnes: For the diurnall motion fulfilleth his courſe within the ſpace of 24. common howers: but the propre motion in diuers diſtances of time, according to the largenes of the orbes: namely, the orbe of the fixed ſtarres performeth his circle, in 36000. yeares: of ♄ in 30: of ♃ in 12: of ♂ in 2. yeares: of the ☉ in 365. dayes, and about 6. houres: of ♀ in 384. dayes, after <hi>Plinie:</hi> the orbe of ☿ in as many dayes as the ☉: and the orbe of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, in 27. daies &amp; 8. howres.</p>

                     <p>The one experiment is taken from the ſtarres of the 8. orbe, which both in their riſing &amp; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, do alwaies keepe one &amp; the ſame habitude, both in regarde of the earth, and one to another: which thing can agree with none other then a circulare motion about the centre.</p>
                     <p>The other experiment is alſo taken from the ſtarres of the 8. orbe, alwaies appearing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in diuers places the ſame diſtance from

                     <p>The firſt argument is deriued from the conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of 2. opinions, wherof the one ſuppoſeth thàt the motion of the heauen is direct and inſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: which if it were, the ſtarres ſhould vaniſhe out of our ſight: The other, that the ſtarres in their ſetting are quenched, and in their riſing are lighted againe: as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> affirmed, which is abſurd, both in reſpect of the motion, which is perpetuall and conſtant in it ſelfe: and of the contrary power, which cannot be in the earth: as alſo in regarde of our Antipodes, whoſe Weſt is our Eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond argument is drawen from the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie thereof: For the circulare motion is the moſt worthye, and more perfect then the right motion, inaſmuch as it breedeth no ſciſsion or cutting, and is made about the midſt of the whole, not by diſplacing the whole bodie, but by the onlie vnchangeable ſucceſſion of the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the partes.</p>
                     <p>The criculare figure of the Heauen is proued partely by ſimilitude, and partely by reaſons.</p>

                     <p>The reaſons do containe either the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the circulare figure, or the neceſſitie.</p>

                     <p>The acception of the name Circle, is of two ſortes, Geometricall, and Aſtronomicall.</p>
                     <p>The Geometricall acception, is when a circle is taken for a plane figure, which one line equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant from the centre doth encompaſſe.</p>

                     <p>The firſt are paralleles, in number 5. namely the 2. polares, the 2. tropicks, and the Equator, all which haue the ſame poles with the world,

                     <p>The ſecond are oblique circles, in number 3. namely the Zodiak ſeruing the ſecond motion, the Horizon, the milke way, all the which lye oblique betweene the poles.</p>

                     <p>The definition taketh holde both of the names thereof, and of the matter it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>It is called the circle Meridian, Meridionall, and Merinoctiall, the circle of the midday and midnight, either becauſe it diuideth both the day and the night into 2. equall partes, the one aſcending, the other deſcending: or els, becauſe ſo often as the ☉, according to the firſt motion, is vnder the Meridian, it is then either midday, or els midnight.</p>

                     <p>In the riſing are to be conſidered the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the bipartite diuiſion.</p>
                     <p>The definition is either of the name, or of the matter.</p>

                     <p>FOraſmuch as there hath bene often mention made of the ſhadowes, it ſhall not be amiſſe if we ſet before your eyes, the methodicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription thereof: and ſeeing that contraties are by their contraries made more manifeſt, we will declare the nature of the light, and of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe.</p>
                     <p>The nature of the light is ſhewed by the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, the diuiſion, and the cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>It is defined to be the image, or the beame of the bright light.</p>
                     <p>It is diuided, either into the firſt and principal, or the ſecondarie and reflexed light.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and principall is that, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth directly from the light body, and is either perpendiculare, or oblique.</p>
                     <p>The perpendiculare light is that, by the fall whereof right angles are made.</p>
                     <p>The oblique light is that which falleth not at right angles.</p>
                     <p>The ſecondarie or reflexed light is that, which from one ſide ſpreadeth it ſelfe on al parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any falling of the beames.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of the light is either the Elementall bright light, whereof here we teach nothing, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the celeſtiall.</p>
                     <p>The celeſtiall bright light, is that which either
<pb facs="tcp:49262:90"/>cauſeth the ſhadowe, as that of the ☉, of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, of ♀: or els, which hath no power to make any ſhadow, as the light of the of the other Starres.</p>
                     <p>The nature of the ſhadowe is declared by the definition, and by the diuiſion thereof.</p>
                     <p>It is defined to be a light diminiſhed: or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten forme of a darke body, alwaies contrarie to the body caſting the light.</p>
                     <p>The diuiſion thereof is two folde, the one drawen from the coaſtes of the worlde, the other from the poſition of the darke body.</p>
                     <p>The ſhadowe taking the appellation from the coaſtes of the worlde, is of 2. ſorts.</p>
                     <p>The one is extended toward ſome coaſte, and it is either Orientall, or Occidentall, or Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, or Septentrionall.</p>
                     <p>The other is perpendiculare, or a right ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe by a perpendiculare, which is not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as it is vnto thoſe, that haue the ☉ in their Zenith.</p>
                     <p>The diuiſion deriued from the poſition of the darke bodie is that, in reſpect whereof one ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe is called right or extended, another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed.</p>
                     <p>The right ſhadowe is that, which is cauſed by the darke bodie, perpendicularelie erected vpon the terreſtriall plane.</p>
                     <p>The reuerſed ſhadowe is that, which is cauſed by the darke bodie, that is parallele vnto the Horizon.</p>

                     <p>OF al the appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the heauen, the Eclipſe is the principall: and therefore we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the generall reaſon of the ſame, by the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and by the termes thereof.</p>
                     <p>The definition is either barelye and planelye propounded, or els it is more largely expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>The plane definition thereof is that, whereby it is defined to be the taking away, or the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the bright light, ſo that it cannot come vnto the eye.</p>
                     <p>The larger expreſſion thereof is thus: vnto euery Eclipſe there belong 3. thinges: a bright heauenly light, our ſight, and a ſhadowy or dark bodie.</p>
                     <p>The bright heauenly light was formed by the Creator, for the expelling of ſhadowes, and it is twofolde, a greater and a leſſe.</p>
                     <p>The greater, is that of the ☉, ſhining of it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The leſſe is that of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, caſting about (as out of a looking glaſſe) her light borowed of the ☉.</p>
                     <p>Our ſyght is diuerſe, according to the diuerſe poſition thereof, vppon the round compaſſe of the earth.</p>
                     <p>The ſhadowy or darke bodie is alſo twofold, viz. the bodie of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, the one moitie whereof the ☉ enlighteneth not: and the earth, whoſe ſhadow is alwaies oppoſite vnto the ☉.</p>
                     <p>The termes of the Eclipſe, which in this kinde
<pb facs="tcp:49262:91"/>of doctrine the Aſtronomers do vſe, are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber three.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the quantity of the bodie either of the ☉, whoſe viſuall diameter (as a chord) doth ſubtende in the Auge of his eccentricke 31. mi. and in the oppoſite thereof 31. mi. or elſe of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, whoſe apparent diameter doth in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of her eccentricke and epicycle, ſubtende 29. mi. and in the oppoſite thereof 36. mi.</p>
                     <p>The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is the quantity of the ſhadow, which the motion of the ☉ through either <hi>Abſis,</hi> doth canſe to varie, aſwell in regard of the longitude from the ſurface of the earth, which for the moſt part conteineth 276. ſemidiameters of the earth, as alſo in reſpect of the latitude, which alſo in the place of the ouerthwart croſſing of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is diners, both in reſpect of the ☉, beeing in either <hi>Abſis,</hi> and of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> which in her oppoſition is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Auge</hi> of her epicycle, and then it is 75. mi. or in the oppoſite thereof, and then it conteineth 94. mi.</p>
                     <p>The third is the quantity of the termes eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, either of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, which are 15. partes 12. mi. or of the ☉, by reaſon of the <hi>Parallux</hi> of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, being either about the South, and it is 11. gr, 22. mi. or about the North, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 20. gr. 40. mi.</p>

                     <p>The beames of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> being borowed, may bee hindered by the comming of the earth, and the ſhadow thereof, betweene the ☉ and her, and that maketh the Eclipſe of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, whereof wee may conſider the time wherein it happeneth, &amp; the continuance thereof.</p>
                     <p>The time of her eclipſe is when ſhee is at the full, when the ☉, being in oppoſition with the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, driueth the ſhadowe either according to the longitude, as euerye moneth it commeth to paſſe, or els according to the latitude, whiche falleth out when the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is either within or nigh vnto the <hi>Nodi,</hi> that is, the head and taile of the Dragon.</p>
                     <p>In the continuance it is to be conſidered, that the ſtaye of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> in her darkening, is either long or ſhort.</p>
                     <p>The long ſtay is with her whole bodie, when her oppoſition falleth out preciſely in the <hi>Nodi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſhort ſtay is when ſhe is diſtant from the <hi>Nodi,</hi> and then her body is darkened either all, or halfe, or leſſe then the halfe.</p>
                     <p>Shee is darkened wholly, when ſhee hath her latitude leſſe then the ſemidiameter of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, by the quantity of her apparent ſemidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</p>
                     <p>Shee is darkened halfe, when ſhe hath her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude equall vnto the ſemidiameter of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
                     <p>Shee is darkened leſſe then the halfe, when ſhe hath her latitude greater then the ſemidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the ſhadow.</p>
                     <p>The beames of the ☉ are hindered by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and that is called the Eclipſe
<pb facs="tcp:49262:92"/>of the ☉, wherein wee may haue conſideration of the tyme wherein it happeneth, the diuerſitie thereof, and the difference thereof from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>.</p>
                     <p>The time wherein the ☉ is eclipſed, is in the new <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, at which time ſhe ſeemeth to haue a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrall coniunction with the ☉, aſwell in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of longitude, as of latitude.</p>
                     <p>The diuerſitie thereof is, in that it is eclipſed either wholly, or leſſe then all.</p>
                     <p>The ☉ is wholly eclipſed, when the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> beeing in viſible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction with the ☉, is in the <hi>Nodi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ☉ is eclipſed leſſe then wholly, when as the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> being in viſible coniunction with the ☉, hath latitude, but yet leſſe then 35. mi. or els, when the ſemidiameters of the ☉ and the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> are ioyned together.</p>
                     <p>The difference of the Eclipſe of the ☉ from the eclipſe of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, is in regarde of the time, the continuance, and the vniuerſalitie.</p>
                     <p>The difference conſidered in the time, is in that the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is darkened in the oppoſition, but the ☉ in the coniunction.</p>
                     <p>The difference co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in the continuance, is in that the darkening of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> falleth out to be long, but the Eclipſe of the ☉ but ſhort, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſmall quantity of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and the ſwifte motion thereof.</p>
                     <p>The difference conſidered in the vniuerſalitie, is in that the Eclipſe of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is euery where ſeene, but the Eclipſe of the ☉, in one onlie parte of the earth, namely in that, which is couered by the ſhadowe of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>.</p>

                  <p>THou haſt here preſented to thy view and cenſure a few Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Notes, moſt whereof have lain by me many years; and the reaſon of their ruſhing into the Publick in this homely dreſs, is, for that I and ſome others have been traduced and derided in a Book lately publiſhed, Entituled, <hi>A Guide to the Young Gager,</hi> put forth by ſeveral Authors: In the tail of which Book there is a whole Broad-ſide (intricate, prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, inartificial, and moſt prodigiouſly erroneous) diſgorged by the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> or <hi>Bringer-up</hi> againſt a Book, Entituled, <hi>The Art of Practical Gauging;</hi> which Book
<pb facs="tcp:49262:94"/>I am ſorry to ſee ſo incumbred with Preſs-Faults, though they were none of mine: But moſt of theſe Guns we ſhall Charge again, and turn them upon this our <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> for we ſcorn to give an Anſwer to his invective Examination, till we have firſt examined him.</p>
                  <p>In his <hi>Stereo. prop.</hi> pag. 6. pr. 2. he tells how to find the Solidity of a Fruſtum Pyramide whoſe baſes are parallel but not alike: The word <hi>Fruſtum Pyramide</hi> I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but if he had ſaid Fruſtum of a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramide, he would have been underſtood by every judicious man: But the Solid there ſpoken of (as I am informed) might very fitly have been called a <hi>Priſmoid,</hi> for it is a kind of a Priſm; for although the Sides thereof ſhould be continued, they would never be included or terminated in one point, as the Pyramide is; therefore, why Fruſtum Pyramide?</p>
                  <p>For the conſtruction of this his Fruſtum Pyramide, he bringeth (as an induction of particulars) four Pyramides, four Priſms, and a Parallelepipedon, that is in all five Priſms; (for a Parallelepipedon is a Priſm) but in reality there is but two Priſms, and
<pb facs="tcp:49262:94"/>the four Pyramides, which are indeed but one Pyramide, in the largeſt ſenſe it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, both baſes being parallel but not alike, each being a rectangle.</p>
                  <p>In his Propoſition pag. 105. (which he proſecutes in pag. 106, 107, 108.) the ſtreſs of his Argument is weak and infirm (I paſs by the Preſs-Fault pag. 105. <hi>z</hi>+2 for it ſhould be <hi>z</hi> − 2) for pag. 106. he ſaith <hi>z</hi>=⅗ that is <hi>z</hi> is 3 and A, 5; theſe numbers make good the Queſtion: But ſtay, though we ſhould grant <hi>z</hi>=⅗, it is yet to demonſtrate, that <hi>z</hi> is 3 and A, 5; which I am not bound to tell him how to do: But it is evident the man made haſt to the 108 page, to fling dirt in the face of <hi>Van Schooten</hi> (for he doth not care who he doth beſpatter) and it is manifeſt, if you compare this laſt page with his Title page, which ſaith, <hi>Particularly intended for Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;</hi> let any man judge, whether this Propoſition have any relation at all to Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. But we would have him to know, that we can perform this Propoſition and two other, of good uſe for the rational Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinates of the Circle and Hyperbola, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out caſting dirt in the face of any perſon.</p>

                  <p>In his invective Examination, Pag 1. he ſaith, That our Equation is five times greater than it needs: If he could have ſaid it had required five times more work in the operation, he had ſaid ſomething; but to ſee how full he is fraught with Envy, for this very Propoſition hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by divers Artiſts in this City, for the contrivance of it, becauſe it doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate both the Spheroid and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical Spindle with one and the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:49262:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>Diviſor, and the Operation is very near as ſhort as the old way for the Spheroid.</p>
                  <p>From the firſt page to the twelfth he is wholely taken up with inveighing againſt the Table of Segments; in which I ſee there are many Preſs Faults, but theſe Faults (as I ſaid before) are none of my Faults: For the making of the Table I gave this Rule, 6,2831853) ∶ 0,017453 A − S ∶ × Q (=K, which I ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt from <hi>Archimedes, Snellius,</hi> and other Authors, that if the Radius of a Circle be Unity, that then the Area of that Circle is 3,14159266 too much, or 3,14159265 too little: Alſo from the ſame Authors it holds, that the Area of a Sector is equal to the Fact or Rectangle of the Radius into ½ the Arch or Baſe of the Sector: Then if you put A=to the Arch, S=to the Sine of that Arch, it muſt hold 1 × ½A=the Area of the Sector, and 1 × ½S=the Area of the Triangle in the Sector; but the Sector leſs the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle is equal to the Segment of the Circle in that Sector: So then ½A − ½S=any Segment of a Circle whoſe Radius is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49262:96"/>
                  <p>And by the 11. and 12. Prop. <hi>Partis Cyclicae</hi> of <hi>Leotaud's Examen</hi> of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratures of <hi>Greg.</hi> of St. <hi>Vine.</hi> it holds; As the Area of the Circle given 3,14159265, is to ½ A − ½ S; ſo is Q, the Quadrature or Area of any Circle propoſed, to K, its like Segment. Then multiplying both the firſt and ſecond terms by 2, in Jimbals (for ſo he calls the Symbols in deriſion) it will ſtand thus; 6,2831853) ∶ A−S ∷× Q∶(=K.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe A ſtands in Degrees and Centeſmes, it muſt be reduced to the ſame parts that S ſtands in, which may be done thus; As 360 deg. the whole Peripheria in the Parts of A, is to 6,2831853 the whole Peripheria in the parts of S; ſo is A, to 0,017453A: therefore 0,017453A, comes in the room of A, and the Rule ſtands thus; 6,2831853)∶0,017453A−S∷×Q(∶=K which was to be demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>In page 12. this inſulting Scoſſer ſaith, <hi>This may ſerve for inſtruction to Segment-Makers for the future, to inform them whether their Work goes on regularly or not.</hi>

                  <p>Reader, I hope thou haſt more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than to take this <hi>Bringer-up</hi> for one that modeſtly makes publick pure <hi>Geometry</hi> (as he ſpeaks in his Preface.) But if thou doſt, I ſhall undeceive thee: For it is apparently true, that if a Table of the Segments of a Circle ſhall be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced never ſo often, they have no equal Differences; but he ſeems to intimate that they have: For if he mean otherwiſe, I would fain know of him the Habitude of that rank of Differences by which he will prove the truth of a Table of Segments. But methinks I hear the Reader object and ſay, That if a Table of Segments be differenced far enough, the Differences at laſt will be equal: Stay there, herein lies the deception; for thoſe Figures that appear to be equal, are only frontier-Figures, and if you make the Table of Segments a good company of places lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, you will then ſee the ragged Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſtands behind theſe Frontiers. This he ought to have told his Reader, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he publiſheth (not pure, but) very impure <hi>Geometry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In page 13. he proceeds to the Trial of
<pb facs="tcp:49262:97"/>the Tables of Wine, and Beer and Ale; and the Table for dividing the Gaging Rod, and he concludes them alſo badly calculated, as may be proved (ſaith he) by taking the ſecond or third Differences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What? the ſecond, or the third?</hi> 'Tis a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel when his hand was in, he had not put in the <hi>fourth</hi> Differences too: <hi>O ye Blind Guides!</hi> know ye not that the Tables for Wine, Ale and Beer, are capable but only of the firſt and ſecond Differences; which I prove thus for the Wine: the conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Wine Table is the Square of any Diameter in Inches, divided by 883. Then if you put D=a Diameter propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (do you ſee now) in Jimbals it will ſtand thus:

<pb facs="tcp:49262:98"/>and in the Peripetaſma a Right Line may be every where applied, from one Baſe to another.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Pyramide</hi> of the ſame Baſe and height with the Priſm, is ⅓ thereof: And in the Peripetaſma a Right Line may be every where applied, from the Baſe to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Pyramidoid</hi> of the ſame baſe and height with the Priſm, is ſome certain portion thereof; as if it be parabolical, it is ½ if it be ſpherical, it is ⅔: And in the Peripetaſma a Right Line may be no where applied from the Baſe to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex.</p>
                  <p>For my Diviſion, it is ſuch as is uſed by others: As for Example, 24)∶37+41∶×4(=13. and may be read thus; 24 dividing 37 more 41, multiplyed by 4, equal to (or quotes) 13: Or it may be read by analogie thus: As 24, is to 37 more 41; ſo is 4, to 13. If thou meereſt with ſome Diviſions that ſtand double lined, they were things that had lain by me a good while, and I would not ſtand to alter them.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Right lines applyed to a Circle are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49262:101"/>Chords, Sines, Tangents, Secants, and verſed Sines.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Chord of an Arch is a right line extended from one end of that Arch to the other end thereof: The Sine is a right line drawn from one end of that Arch, Perpendicularly upon the Diameter drawn from the other end of that Arch: The Tangent is a right line touching one end of that Arch extended till it Concur with the Secant: The Secant is a right line extended from the Center of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle till it Concur with the Tangent: The Verſed Sine is a right line being a Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Diameter, drawn from one end of that Arch till it be cut by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular (i. e. the Sine) from the other end of that Arch.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is to be noted by this Definition in Prop. 3. that the Chord of an Arch is common to two Arches, one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Complement of the other to a whole Circle; and likewiſe the Verſed Sine is common to two Arches, one of them being the Complement of the other to a whole Circle: But the Sine of an Arch is common to two Arches, one of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49262:101"/>them being the Complement of the other to a Semi-circle.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As the Sum of two Sines is to their difference, ſo is the Tangent of the ½ Sum of thoſe Arches, to the Tangent of their ½ difference.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As the Sum of two Tangents, is to their Difference, ſo is the Sine of the Sum of thoſe Arches, to the Sine of their Difference.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. As the Sine of the Sum of two Arches, is to the Sum of their Sines, ſo is the difference of thoſe Sines, to the Sine of their Difference.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If you put R=The Radiu<hi rend="sup">s</hi> of a Circle, A=an Arch propoſed, C=the Chord of that Arch, S=the Sine of that Arch, T=the Tangent of that Arch, and Z=the Secant of that Arch.</p>

                     <p n="10">10. And hence, if a rank of Arches be equi-different, As the Sine of any Arch in that rank, is to the ſum of the Sines of any two Arches equally remote from it on each ſide; So is the Sine of any other Arch in the ſaid rank, to the ſum of the Sines of two Arches next to it on each ſide, having the ſame common diſtance.</p>

From the laſt before going, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if two thirds (i.e either the former, or the latter 60 deg. or the former 30 deg. and the latter 30 deg.) of the Quadrant be compleated with Sines: the remaining third part of the Quadrant maybe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by Addition or Subduction onely.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. If in a Circle, two right lines be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed cutting each other, The Rectangles of the Segments of each line are equal.
